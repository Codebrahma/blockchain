# Blockchain

A simple block chain implementation with node-js

Itâ€™s just an array of blocks, with each block having a connection to the previous one

To run, `DB_PATH=./db node app.js`


# Persistance
We use level-db to persist the block-chain.

Environment variable `DB_PATH` points to the database.

Lev for DB CLI : https://github.com/0x00A/lev

# Testing

```
# to run test
npm test
```
